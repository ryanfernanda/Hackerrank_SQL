# Hackerrank SQL Preparation

This repository was created as a learning source to answer some SQL challenge questions on the HackerRank platform. Kindly access this repository as a learning guide if you really don't know how to answer particular questions and you need guidance to solve the problem at hand. 

There are six subdomains included in this repository that are separated on each folders:
- Basic Select : https://github.com/ryanfernanda/Hackerrank_SQL_Challenges/tree/main/Basic_Select
- Advanced Select : https://github.com/ryanfernanda/Hackerrank_SQL_Challenges/tree/main/Advanced_Select

There are so many challenge questions that are not included in this repository, but we will try our best to answer as many questions as possible. Please use this platform responsibly, not just to get certain badges without getting any insights from the questions.
